    <h1>Sculpting software</h1>
    <p>An interactive essay on Behavioral Programming</p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="first">
    Automation has taken over many things in our society: agriculture, medicine, transport, entertainment. Many say that the future depends on software; unprecedented global problems are already in a state of no-return and fixing these problems will require unseen complex technological systems, most likelydriven by software.  The way we control these layers of automation, that we have become so dependenton, is through “programming”.
    </p>
    <p>
    The problem seems that we (humans) have to abnormally force our minds to learn programming. We adapt our unskilled reasoning to work in the way the computer wants.  As the layers of abstractionsand  patterns  grow  bigger  and  stronger,  the  same  fundamental  issue  remains:   programming  is  anunnatural  process  that  will  forever  require  us  to  override  our  natural  model  of  thinking  in  order  tolearn to think like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
    What  if  we  could  take  the  opposite  road: <i>figure  out  which  paradigms  best  fits  our  model  of thinking</i>; since that is precisely one thing that will hardly change.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this article we will take a look at one of the paradigms that seems to go towards this direction: <i>Behavioral Programming</i> (BP). We will see how programming this way does not need to adhere so rigorously to structure and is more aligned with how we generally think about things.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will drive the discussion through real-world examples and compare current standard programming practices to see how BP differs and how. Demonstrating that new paradigms are better fit for specific tasks is difficult, hence we will try our best to provide some evidence of this using three dimensions: (i) <b>understandable</b> (how easy it is to understand what the system is doing and why), (ii) <b>changeable</b> (how easy it is to make changes to the system) and (iii) <b>aligned with requirements</b> (how easily we can take requirements and confidently say: this is implemented in the system or not).
